        <h3 class="fw-bold text-center">3. What is event bubble?</h3>
        <span class="fw-bold text-decoration-underline">Answer</span> <article>
            Event bubbling is a mechanism in the Document Object Model (DOM) by which an event triggered on an element is propagated up through its parent elements until it reaches the top-most parent element. This means that when an event is triggered on an element, it is first handled by that element and then "bubbles up" to its parent elements one by one, until it reaches the top-most parent element.

        <h3 class="fw-bold text-center">4. What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h3>
        <span class="fw-bold text-decoration-underline">Answer</span> <article>
            A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, and is executed by that function at a certain point in time or in response to a certain event. The purpose of a callback function is to allow the calling function to execute some behavior or logic after the callback function has completed.
            <br>
            callback functions are a powerful and flexible tool in programming, and are used in many different contexts to control the flow of execution and enable dynamic behavior in code.
